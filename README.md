# ü¶ü Estimating Recent Effective Population size from Resistance Loci in _Anopheles gambiae_

We present MEOWSS ‚Äî _Multi-origin Estimation Of Widespread Soft Sweeps_ <br/>
A simple heuristic method that applies time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA)-based hierarchical clustering on haplotypes sampled from populations undergoing soft selective sweeps.
It is designed to estimate the number of independent origins (ùúÇ) and infer very recent effective population sizes (N<sub>e</sub>) using the semi-deterministic theory [(Khatri & Burt, 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/9/2040/5435963) <br/>

## ü™ú Workflow
a brief outline of the experimental workflow, more details on [my report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/151sB2UNQ25oAq-I8lZecM9KjynHKLwHxQE8o99DtFuk/edit?usp=sharing)
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Soft Sweep Simulations in [SLiM 4](https://messerlab.org/slim/)
1. Create burn-in populations (store in `.trees` files)
2. Start Soft Sweep simulation with the burn-ins
3. outputs: `.trees`, `.vcf`, `.sample_ID.txt`
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ VCF Preprocessing
1. Remove all m0 mutations at the sweep site
2. convert .vcf into .vcz
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ MEOWSS TMRCA-based Haplotype Clustering
1. input: `.vcz`, threshold for t<sub>hom</sub> & smoothing points
2. Estimating Shared Haplotype Length 
3. Calculating TMRCA of Haplotype Pairs
4. Haplotype Clustering 
5. output: `Z.npy`, `cols.npy`, dendrogram
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis
1. intput: `Z.npy`, `cols.npy`, `.trees`
2. scores dendrograms
3. labels dendrograms by true haplotype origin
4. Determining ùúÇ for t<sub>clus</sub> = 1-4
5. get cophenetic correlation coefficient between Z linkage from true genealogy and MEOWSS-inferred genealogy
6. Calculate N<sub>e</sub> by maximum likelihood estimation 


## ü´Ç To the next Student!

Inheriting this project was super tricky but it gets better (and more fun!) as you progress! just keep going and dont give up! :3
